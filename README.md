# Website for my blog

A minimalistic personal blog and learning documentation website built with Next.js, Tailwind, and TypeScript.

>[!NOTE]
>**October 21, 2025**: This repo has been archived (& my site has been wiped) because I want to move away from Next.js and Vercel (due to various reasons, but primarily [this](https://x.com/paulbiggar/status/1972731712607047708?s=46)). You are still free to do whatever you want with this code since it works pretty well. But if you're like me, you probably don't wanna touch things Vercel anymore.

## Want to use this code for your own site?

You are free to copy any part of this repository or even the entire thing. All I ask of you is to star this repository if you found it useful and maybe provide some credit & shoutout if you're feeling kind (but you don't have to if your vibes are not into these) :)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sumitdotml/website.git
```

2. Go to the project directory

```bash
cd website
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the development server

npm run dev
```

5. Open the website in your browser

```bash

You may run into some issues when doing `npm install` because of the dependencies. You can always ask our AI friends to help you out. :)
